### Call by value function in objective c

The **call by value** method of passing arguments to a function copies 
the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. 
In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have 
no effect on the argument.

By default, Objective-C programming language uses call by value method 
to pass arguments. In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.
